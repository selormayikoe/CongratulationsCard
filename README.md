# CongratulationsCard
Udacity Make your Own Card Project 
This Congratulations Card was created as part of the Google Udacity Africa Scholarship Android Basics track. 
It is designed to congratulate a friend of mine who has excelled in his examinations. 
The app was made with a LinearLayout, TextViews and an ImageView.
